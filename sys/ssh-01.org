#+DATE: [2021-06-17 Thu]


* Notes
** Aliases are specified in the ~/.ssh/config file
** Aliases make it easier to connect with ssh as we don't have to remember hostnames or users
** Aliases can be created in different combinations:
*** For a hostname only
*** For a user and hostname
*** For a user, hostname and SSH port
** The hostname may be an IP address or a domain name
** If no port is specified, the default of 22 is assumed
** If no user is aliased, the user would have to be mentioned at the time of connection
** Examples
*** Add the following lines to ~/.ssh/config and connect with ssh host1
Host host1
    HostName 192.168.225.22
    User john.doe
*** Add the following lines to  ~/.ssh/config and connect with ssh host2
Host host2
    HostName server.example.com
    User root
*** Add the following lines to vi ~/.ssh/config and connect with ssh host3
Host host3
    HostName 192.168.1.2
    User jane.doe
    Port 223
