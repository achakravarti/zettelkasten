* Downgrading a package may require dependencies to be downgraded too.
* Pacman handles required changes to configuration files if the safeguards are not
  bypassed.
* If a downgrade involves a soname change, all dependencies may need to be 
  downgraded or rebuilt.
* Version conflicts, if they occur, need to be handled manually.
* First search in the Pacman cache:
** sudo pacman -U /var/cache/pacman/pkg/<pkg_name>
* If not available, then search in the Arch Linux Archive
** https://archive.archlinux.org/packages/
** The packages are sorted alphabetically
** Download the appropriate *.pkg.tar.xz file
** sudo pacman -U <downloaded_pkg>
