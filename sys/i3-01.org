#+DESCRIPTION: How to set the default workspace in which an application will open in i3
#+FILETAGS: :sys:i3:workspace
#+DATE:[2021-06-22 Tue]

* Notes
** The default workspace for an application can be specified in the i3 config file.
** The window manager class of the application needs to be associated with a workspace.
** The window manager class can be determined using the xprop utility
* Steps
1. Open the application for which the default workspace has to be set.
2. Open xprop in a separate terminal window.
3. Click on the application.
4. The second string in the output WM_CLASS property is the application class.
5. Add the following lines to ~/.config/i3/config:
   #+BEGIN_SRC
   # "Slack" is the WM class for Slack, obtained from xprop
   # $ws1 is a user-defined variable identifying workspace number 1
   assign [class="Slack"] $ws1
   #+END_SRC
