#+DESCRIPTION: How to handle an "unable to lock database" error
#+FILETAGS: :sys:pacman:lock:
#+DATE: [2021-06-09 Wed] 

* When working, pacman temporarily writes to /var/lib/pacman/db.lck
* When completed, pacman deletes this file.
* However, if pacman is interrupted before this lock file is deleted, future
  synchornisation operations with pacman result in an error.
* The error reported is "failed to synchronize all databases (unable to lock
  database)"
* To fix this error, simply sudo rm /var/lib/pacman/db.lck
