* Discrete Mathematics vs. Calculus
  - Discrete mathematics describes the processes that consist of a sequence of individual steps
  - Calculus describes processes that change in a continuous fashion
  - Calculus was the basis of the science and technology of the Industrial Age
  - Discrete Mathematics is the basis of the science and technology of the Information Age
    
* Main Themes
** Logic and Proof
   - Using logically valid forms of argument
   - Avoiding common logical errors
   - Reasoning from definitions
   - Using direct and indirect arguments to derive new results from existing true statements
   - Working with symbolic representations
     
** Induction and Recursion
   - Recursion solves problems by putting together solutions to similar smaller problems
   - Induction is used to verify the formulas resulting from recursive thinking
     
** Discrete Structures
   - The abstract structures that describe, categorise and reveal relationships among
     discrete mathematical objects
*** Examples:
    * Sets
    * Boolean algebras
    * Functions
    * Relations
    * Graphs and trees
    * Formal languages and regular expressions
    * Finite-state automata
      
** Combinatorics and Discrete Probability
   - Combinatorics is the mathematics of counting and arranging objects
   - Probability is the study of random or chance events
   - Discrete probability focuses of situations involving discrete sets of objects
     
** Algorithms and Their Analysis
   - An algorithm is a step-by-step sequence followed by a computer to solve a problem
   - Induction is used to determin if an algorithm is correct
   - Performance of algorithms is measured using concepts of discrete mathematics
     
** Applications and Modelling
   - Abstract mathematical ideas often have much practical utility
   - The smae mathematical model can be used to solve problems in situations that
     superficially appear dissimilar
